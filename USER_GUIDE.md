# 🗺️ ATLAS_CORE: Survival Guide for World Builders

Hello, creative entity! 👋

Welcome to **Atlas_Core**. If you are here, it's probably because you got tired of typing *"cool fantasy map"* into Midjourney and receiving an image of a potato with roads. Don't worry, happens to the best of us.

This tool is basically an **exoskeleton for your imagination**. You provide the idea (or let chaos decide for you), and Atlas_Core spits out a technical text block so precise that the AI will have no choice but to obey you.

## 🚀 What on earth is this?

Atlas_Core is a **technical prompt generator** (instructions for generative AIs).
It is used to create **Maps, Scenarios, Characters, and User Interfaces (UI)** for video games, RPGs, or novels.

**It does not generate images directly** (we don't do black magic yet), it generates the *perfect text* for you to paste into Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion, or Gemini so they can do the dirty work.

## 🎛️ The Three Modes of Happiness

The app has three personalities, depending on how much you want to work today:

### 1. 🏗️ THE CONSTRUCTOR (Mode "I'm in a Rush")
Ideal for when you need inspiration **NOW** or feel too lazy to think.

*   **What does it do?** Offers predefined and curated prototypes.
*   **The Magic Button:** There is a button that says **"GENERATE NEW PROTOTYPES"** (or shuffle icon). Press it. The system will mix civilizations, places, and art styles randomly but coherently (or not, sometimes you get "Cyberpunk Ancient Egypt" and it rocks).
*   **Usage:** See a card you like -> Click -> Prompt copied -> Go generate.

### 2. 📐 THE ARCHITECT (Mode "Control Freak")
For when you have an exact vision in your head and no one is going to tell you how to design your dungeon.

*   **Step by Step:** A wizard guides you through 10 steps. Scale, Theme, Civilization, Weather, Camera...
*   **Visual DNA:** This is where the magic happens. You define the exact style (Zelda? Dark Souls? Wes Anderson?).
*   **📸 New Feature - Style Theft (Oops, sorry, "Extraction"):**
    Do you have an image with a killer style and want to copy it? In step 6, upload that image. Atlas_Core will use its bionic eyes (Gemini Vision) to technically analyze the style and apply it to your prompt. Easy peasy.

### 3. 🔮 STORYCRAFTER (Mode "I want to make a whole game")
This is the heavyweight. Designed to create **coherent collections**. Because it's useless to have a "Pixel Art" map and an "Italian Renaissance" style character.

*   **The Flow:**
    1.  Choose a Race and a Place (or let chance decide).
    2.  Atlas_Core invents the context.
    3.  **Generate POIs:** Press the button and the AI will invent 6 logical places inside your building (e.g., if it's a Spaceship, it will suggest "Engine Room", "Command Bridge", etc.).
*   **The 3 Power Buttons:**
    *   🌍 **World:** Generates tactical map, isometric views, and the 6 interiors.
    *   🔮 **UI:** Generates buttons, dialog windows, and health bars that match your civilization.
    *   ⚔️ **Characters:** Generates the Hero, Villain, NPCs, Pet, and even a sheet of badges (tokens) with their faces.
*   **Result:** A huge list of prompts that share the same visual DNA. Copy everything, paste it into your generator, and go to sleep.

## 🧠 Artificial Intelligence (Your Digital Intern)

Atlas_Core is not alone. It has Gemini (Google's AI) locked in the basement working for you.

*   **Enhance with AI:** Is your prompt bland? Hit this button and Gemini will rewrite it using pedantic art critic words ("volumetric lighting", "subsurface scattering", "chiaroscuro").
*   **Derive Scene:** Like the place but want to see another room? Hit the button and the AI will imagine an adjacent room.

## ⚙️ Technical Configuration (The Fine Print)

In step 10 (or at the bottom), you choose the AI dialect:

1.  **Universal:** Rich natural language. Works well in DALL-E 3 and Gemini.
2.  **Midjourney:** The gold standard. Adds weird parameters like `--ar 16:9 --stylize 250`. If you use MJ, use this.
3.  **Technical (SD):** Just keywords separated by commas. For the brave souls using Stable Diffusion or ComfyUI.

## ⚠️ Final Warnings

*   **Anachronisms:** If you mix "Vikings" with "Far Future", the tool will judge you silently, but it will generate an amazing prompt about Space Vikings.
*   **Memory:** There is a "MEMORY" button at the top. It saves your last 100 prompts. Use it before closing the tab and losing the masterpiece of your life.

Now go and create worlds! (And if they turn out bad, blame the AI).
